# Snake-game

In this project, I recreated the well-known Snake game in Python programming language.

The user can either start a new standard game, or choose to modify it in the settings. He can change aspects like the background color, the snake color, the food color and the snake's the speed. Also, he can choose if he wants to play single or a two player game and the difficulty. The easy option does not make the user lose when the snake touches the game's border, but the difficult does.

If the user chooses the two player option, the first player will have assigned the arrow buttons of the keyboard, and the second player will have assigned the classic 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' combination. The second player's snake will always be pink.

The game is personalised through the fact that besides the normal food, there is a special one that appears randomly and grows the player's score by 3 points. The snake will still only grow by one square. The snakes cannot eat eachother. When one snake dies, it's score is lowered by 5 points, and the winner is calculated.
